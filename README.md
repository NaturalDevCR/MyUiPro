# My Ui Pro (my-ui-pro)

Soundcraft Ui Multiframe Interface

## What is this?
With My Ui Pro you can use your Soundcraft Ui Mixer with multiple frames on a single screen.

It is also possible to control some aspects of the mixer using a shortcuts modal window (on development)

## Compatibility
IT should work on the 3 Ui models right away (Ui12, Ui16, Ui24r), but I personally only have a Ui16, so it's only tested widely on that model, you can try by yourself with your Ui mixer and let me know if there's something missing.

## Get started
* Download the latest HTML file in the releases page.
* Connect your device to the mixer network (wifi or wired).
* Open the downloaded HTML file
* Set your mixer's IP address in the setup window
* Play around with the options.

## Did you lost your Mixer access password?
Usually if you forget your mixer's password, you'll need to reset the password with a USB drive, and a txt file...

But with My Ui Pro app you can recover it easily, just follow the get started instructions to connect to your mixer, then click on the settings button in the top right of the screen (within the My Ui Pro top bar) and you'll see in the setup screen a big red button labeled **SHOW MASTER PASSWORD**, click on it, and you'll be able to see your current password.

### **How the heck can this be possible?**

Well, the guys from Soundcraft expose it in plain text, and it can be retrieved with ease by just connecting to the mixer via websocket connection.

### How to use it on iPad?

The only way I've found so far to open the HTML file on an iPad or iOS device is by using Microsoft Edge Browser, if you find a better way, please let me know.

- Download the HTML file to your iPad storage
- Press and hold your finger on the file using the Files app in your iPad.
- Touch the share icon
- Select Edge Browser
- Select Open in Microsoft Edge
- Done

You'll have to do this every time you want to use the HTML file.

Please only use Edge, Chrome, Safari, or Firefox

### How to use it on MacOS, Windows or Linux?

- Download the HTML file to your computer
- Open the file
- Done

## Limitations
* Keyboard shortcuts won't work and will never work, this is a known limitation for iframes.
* HTML single file version works only on Chrome and Edge, Appearently some firefox versions seem to have problems reported by users

## Build for local access without a server
`yarn run build:spa`

## Tested on
 * Ui16
 * Chrome
 * Firefox

## Working on
* MIDI support (this is in a very alpha state):
The idea is to be able to map some functions to midi devices.
* Shortcuts Modal Window:
A modal window where you'll have some shortcuts ready to use
