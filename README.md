# My Ui Pro (my-ui-pro)

Soundcraft Ui Interface

## Intro
This App has been made with the purpose of showing multiple frames in a single window to access the Ui interface, you can also switch between layers.

It's also possible to access quick shortcuts to interact directly with the Ui.

## Compatibility
IT should work on the 3 Ui models right away (Ui12, Ui16, Ui24r)

## Known bugs
Let me know if you find any.

        //viteSingleFile(), //Uncomment to create an inlined single html file and run the app without a web server // Remember to fix assets routes from / to ./ directly in the html file
        ...
```

## Limitations

* HTML single file version works only on Chrome and Edge, Appearently some firefox versions seem to have problems reported by users

## Tested on
 * Ui16
 * Chrome v108.0.5359.94
